## About Stock Wizard
Stock Wizard is a personal project that I built during the year 1 summer break in 2025. It puts together my passion for web development and quantitative finance.

## What it does
Currently, it offers stock screening with indicators such as annualized return, annualied volatility and sharpe ratio.
Advanced analytics include rolling statistics for different windows too.
It allows comparison between different securities including equity and ETFs.

## Tech Stacks
- React
- Redux (RTK)
- Node.js
- Express.js
- YahooFinance API

## Outlook for Stock Wizard
Over the next few months, I'll expand on the features to include 
- more sophisticated quantitative finance analytics (SARIMA time-series analysis, etc)
- real-time stock screening
- investment simulation
