## About Stock Wizard  
**Stock Wizard** is a personal project I developed during my Year 1 summer break in 2025. It reflects my passion for both **web development** and **quantitative finance**.

## Features  
The application currently supports stock screening using key indicators such as:  
- **Annualized Return**  
- **Annualized Volatility**  
- **Sharpe Ratio**  

It also provides advanced analytics like rolling statistics over customizable time windows. Users can compare various securities, including both equities and ETFs.

## Tech Stack  
- **React**  
- **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**  
- **Node.js**  
- **Express.js**  
- **Yahoo Finance API**  

## Future Plans  
In the coming months, I plan to enhance Stock Wizard with:  
- More advanced quantitative finance tools (e.g., SARIMA time-series modeling)  
- Real-time stock screening capabilities  
- Investment simulation features
